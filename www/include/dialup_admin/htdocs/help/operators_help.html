	   Additional operators other than = may be used for the attributes 
	   in either the check item, or reply item list.
       The following is a list of operators, and their 
	   meaning.

       Attribute = Value
            Not  allowed  as  a  check  item  for RADIUS protocol 
			attributes.  It is allowed for server configuration
            attributes (Auth-Type, etc), and sets the value of on 
			attribute, only if there is no other  item  of  the
            same attribute.
            As a reply item, it means "add the item to the reply 
			list, but only if there is no other item of the same
            attribute."

       Attribute := Value
            Always matches as a check item, and replaces in the 
			configuration items any attribute of the  same  name.
            If no attribute of that name appears in the request, 
			then this attribute is added.
            As a reply item, it has an identical meaning, but for 
			the reply items, instead of the request items.

       Attribute == Value
            As a check item, it matches if the named attribute is 
			present in the request, AND has the given value.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       Attribute += Value
            Always  matches  as  a check item, and adds the current 
			attribute with value to the list of configuration
            items.
            As a reply item, it has an identical meaning, but the 
			attribute is added to the reply items.

       Attribute != Value
            As a check item, matches if the given attribute is in 
			the request, AND does not have the given value.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       Attribute > Value
            As a check item, it matches if the request contains an 
			attribute with a value greater than the one given.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       Attribute >= Value
            As  a  check item, it matches if the request contains 
			an attribute with a value greater than, or equal to
            the one given.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       Attribute < Value
            As a check item, it matches if the request contains an 
			attribute with a value less than the one given.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       Attribute <= Value
            As a check item, it matches if the request contains an 
			attribute with a value less than, or equal to  the
            one given.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       Attribute =~ Expression
            As  a check item, it matches if the request contains an 
			attribute which matches the given regular expres-
            sion.  This operator may only be applied to string attributes.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       Attribute !~ Expression
            As a check item, it matches if the request contains an 
			attribute which does not match the  given  regular
            expression.  This operator may only be applied to string 
			attributes.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       Attribute =* Value
            As a check item, it matches if the request contains the 
			named attribute, no matter what the value is.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       Attribute !* Value
            As a check item, it matches if the request does not contain 
			the named attribute, no matter what the value
            is.
            Not allowed as a reply item.
